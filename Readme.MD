Tech Stack:

    Backend (Python):
        Framework: Flask/Django (for APIs)
        Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL (for storing user data, trades, etc.)
        Authentication: JWT or OAuth (for secure login)
        Real-time updates: WebSockets for live stock price updates

    Frontend (ReactJS):
        State Management: Redux or React Context API
        UI Framework: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS (to create a sleek, responsive design)
        Real-time updates: WebSockets for price refresh

Features:

    User Authentication: Sign-up, login, and OAuth integration (Google/Facebook)
    Dashboard:
        Display user portfolio
        Real-time stock data with charts (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js)
        Buy/Sell interface for trades
    Stock Search: Allow users to search for stocks by symbol/name.
    Transaction History: Show past buy/sell transactions.
    Real-Time Notifications: Inform users of price movements.

Design:

    Color Scheme:
        Primary colors: Dark green (#0B6E4F), Light green (#66A182), and accent colors like white and black for text and icons.
        Clean, modern layout similar to Robinhood's minimalistic style.
    Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.

Implementation Steps:
Backend (Python):

    Set up the Flask/Django app:
        Set up routes for user registration, login, and stock data retrieval.
        Create APIs for buying and selling stocks.
        Use WebSockets to push real-time price updates to clients.

    Stock Data Retrieval:
        Use an API (e.g., Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance) to pull real-time stock data.
        Store the necessary data in a database for tracking user transactions and stock performance.

    Database:
        Design tables for users, transactions, stock prices, and portfolio holdings.
        Use an ORM like SQLAlchemy (Flask) or Django's ORM.

Frontend (ReactJS):

    Set up React App:
        Create components for the dashboard, stock search, and buy/sell forms.
        Fetch stock data from the backend and display it with charts.
        Use WebSockets to update stock prices in real-time.

    Responsive UI:
        Style the components with Material-UI/Tailwind CSS, matching Robinhoodâ€™s color scheme.
        Add subtle animations for interactions like buying stocks or loading data.
